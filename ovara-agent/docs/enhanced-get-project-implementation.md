# Enhanced get_project Function Implementation

## Overview

The `get_project` function in the MCP server has been enhanced to return comprehensive project details, matching the data structure expected by the frontend when viewing a single project page.

## What Was Changed

### Before
The original `get_project` function only returned basic project information from the projects collection without any populated relationships.

### After
The enhanced function now returns a comprehensive project object that includes:

## Complete Data Structure Returned

### 1. Basic Project Information
- Project ID, name, description
- Status, priority, budget, currency
- Start date, due date, completion date
- Tags, milestones, custom fields
- Creation and modification timestamps
- Audit trail (createdBy, lastModifiedBy)

### 2. Populated Relationships

#### Client Information
```json
{
  "client": {
    "_id": "client_id",
    "user": {
      "_id": "user_id",
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Organization Information
```json
{
  "organization": {
    "_id": "org_id",
    "name": "Organization Name",
    "id": "org_id"
  }
}
```

#### Project Manager
```json
{
  "projectManager": {
    "_id": "manager_id",
    "name": "Manager Name",
    "email": "manager@example.com",
    "role": "project_manager"
  }
}
```

#### Team Members Array
```json
{
  "teamMembers": [
    {
      "_id": "member_id",
      "name": "Team Member",
      "email": "member@example.com",
      "role": "developer",
      "capacity": {...},
      "workload": {...}
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Project Tasks with Assignee Details
```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "_id": "task_id",
      "id": "task_id",
      "name": "Task Name",
      "description": "Task description",
      "status": "in_progress",
      "priority": "high",
      "assignedTo": {
        "_id": "assignee_id",
        "name": "Assignee Name",
        "email": "assignee@example.com",
        "role": "developer"
      },
      "dueDate": "2024-01-15T00:00:00Z",
      "estimatedHours": 8,
      "tags": ["frontend", "urgent"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. Calculated Progress Metrics
```json
{
  "progress": {
    "completionPercentage": 65.5,
    "totalTasks": 10,
    "completedTasks": 6,
    "inProgressTasks": 3,
    "notStartedTasks": 1
  }
}
```

### 5. Documents and Calendar Integration
```json
{
  "documents": [
    {
      "documentId": "doc_id",
      "documentType": "SRS",
      "linkedAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "linkedDocuments": ["doc_id_1", "doc_id_2"],
  "calendarEvents": ["event_id_1", "event_id_2"]
}
```

### 6. Status History and Audit Trail
```json
{
  "statusHistory": [
    {
      "_id": "history_id",
      "id": "history_id",
      "status": "active",
      "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
      "changedBy": "user_id",
      "reason": "Project approved"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Key Features

### 1. Comprehensive Data Population
- Automatically populates all related entities (client, organization, team members, tasks)
- Includes nested relationships (e.g., client.user details)
- Maintains referential integrity

### 2. Real-time Progress Calculation
- Calculates completion percentage based on actual task statuses
- Provides detailed task breakdown by status
- Updates automatically as tasks change

### 3. Frontend Compatibility
- Matches exact data structure expected by frontend components
- Includes both `_id` and `id` fields for compatibility
- Properly serializes ObjectIds to strings for JSON transport

### 4. Efficient Data Retrieval
- Single function call returns all project-related data
- Eliminates need for multiple API calls from frontend
- Optimized database queries for performance

### 5. Flexible Access Control
- Supports optional client_id and organization_id filtering
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing calls
- Proper error handling and validation

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
# Get comprehensive project details
result = get_project("507f1f77bcf86cd799439011")
```

### With Access Control
```python
# Get project with organization filtering
result = get_project(
    project_id="507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
    organization_id="507f1f77bcf86cd799439013"
)
```

### With Client Filtering
```python
# Get project with client filtering
result = get_project(
    project_id="507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
    client_id="507f1f77bcf86cd799439012"
)
```

## Benefits

1. **Reduced API Calls**: Frontend gets all needed data in one request
2. **Consistent Data Structure**: Matches backend controller response format
3. **Real-time Metrics**: Progress calculated from actual task data
4. **Better Performance**: Optimized queries reduce database load
5. **Enhanced User Experience**: Faster page loads with complete data

## Testing

A test script has been created at `tests/test_enhanced_get_project.py` to verify the functionality. Run it to see the comprehensive data structure in action.

## Backward Compatibility

The enhanced function maintains full backward compatibility with existing code while providing the new comprehensive data structure.
