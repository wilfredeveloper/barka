# Project Manager MCP Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implementation of a comprehensive Project Manager Agent using Node.js MCP Server architecture with Python Google ADK agent integration.

## Architecture Summary
- **Node.js MCP Server** in barka-backend (leveraging existing APIs/models)
- **Python Project Manager Agent** in ovara-agent (using Google ADK)
- **6 Grouped Tools** instead of 37 individual tools for scalability
- **Integration with Gaia** (the main orchestrator)

## üéØ Current Implementation Status

**‚úÖ COMPLETED - Phase 1 & 2:**
- üöÄ **Complete MCP Server** with 6 comprehensive tools (26 total actions)
- üîß **All Core Tools:** project_operations, task_operations, team_operations
- üîç **Advanced Tools:** search_operations, analytics_operations, assignment_operations
- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Features:** Skill-based assignment, workload balancing, capacity planning
- üìä **Enterprise Analytics:** Progress tracking, performance metrics, risk analysis
- üõ°Ô∏è **Production Ready:** Comprehensive validation, error handling, logging, TypeScript

**‚úÖ COMPLETED - Phase 3:**
- Python Agent Implementation and MCP Integration

**üîÑ NEXT - Phase 4:**
