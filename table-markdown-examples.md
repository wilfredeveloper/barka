## Testing Instructions

To test these tables:

1. **Admin Chat Page**: Copy any of the above table markdown and send it as a message in the admin chat interface
2. **Client Chat Page**: The tables will render beautifully with the new styling
3. **Ovara Agent**: Tables will also render nicely in the static HTML interface

## Features of the Table Styling

- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Tables scroll horizontally on smaller screens
- ✅ **Dark Theme**: Consistent with the overall dark theme
- ✅ **Hover Effects**: Rows highlight on hover for better UX
- ✅ **Border Styling**: Clean borders with rounded corners
- ✅ **Typography**: Proper font weights and colors for headers vs data
- ✅ **Spacing**: Comfortable padding for readability

## Example Usage in Chat

You can ask the project manager agent questions like:

- "Show me a table of all current projects with their status"
- "Create a team performance report in table format"
- "Display the budget breakdown as a table"
- "Generate a task priority matrix"

The agent responses will now render these tables beautifully!
