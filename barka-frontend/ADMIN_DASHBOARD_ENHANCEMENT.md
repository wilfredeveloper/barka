## Implementation Guidelines

### Color Coding Standards
- **üü¢ Optimal/Good**: `bg-hunter_green-500` (utilization 50-80%)
- **üü° High/Warning**: `bg-brown_sugar-500` (utilization 80-100%)
- **üî¥ Critical/Overloaded**: `bg-chocolate_cosmos-600` (utilization >100%)
- **‚ö™ Underutilized**: `bg-seasalt-300` (utilization <50%)

### Chart Configuration
```typescript
const chartTheme = {
  primary: '#c57b57',      // Brown Sugar
  success: '#436436',      // Hunter Green
  warning: '#b86f4a',      // Brown Sugar 600
  danger: '#5c1a1b',       // Chocolate Cosmos
  neutral: '#f4f7f5'       // Seasalt
};
```

### Responsive Breakpoints
- **Mobile**: Single column layout, simplified charts
- **Tablet**: Two column layout, condensed metrics
- **Desktop**: Full three column layout, detailed visualizations

### Data Refresh Strategy
- **Real-time metrics**: 30-second intervals
- **Performance data**: 5-minute intervals
- **Historical trends**: 15-minute intervals
- **Budget data**: 1-hour intervals
