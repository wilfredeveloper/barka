# Enhanced list_team_members Function Implementation

## Overview

The `list_team_members` function in the MCP server has been enhanced to include comprehensive task details with nested project information for each team member, providing a complete view of team workload and project assignments.

## What Was Enhanced

### Before
The original function only returned basic team member information without any task or project details.

### After
The enhanced function now returns team members with:
- Complete task assignments with project details
- Task summary statistics
- Updated workload calculations
- Project information for each task

## Complete Data Structure Returned

### 1. Team Member Information
```json
{
  "_id": "member_id",
  "id": "member_id",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "role": "developer",
  "availability": "available",
  "skills": ["JavaScript", "React", "Node.js"],
  "expertise": ["Frontend Development"],
  "hourlyRate": 75.00
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Workload Information
```json
{
  "workload": {
    "currentTasks": 3,

      "in_progress_tasks": 2,
      "not_started_tasks": 1,
      "overdue_tasks": 0
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Pagination Information
```json
{
  "pagination": {
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 20,
    "total": 15,
    "pages": 1
  }
}
```

## Key Features

### 1. Nested Task Details
- **Complete Task Information**: Each task includes full details (name, status, priority, due date, etc.)
- **Project Context**: Every task shows which project it belongs to with project status and priority
- **Task Relationships**: Clear mapping between team members and their assigned tasks

### 2. Project Information Integration
- **Project Name**: Shows the name of the project each task belongs to
- **Project Status**: Indicates if the project is active, completed, on hold, etc.
- **Project Priority**: Shows project priority level (low, medium, high, critical)
- **Project Dates**: Includes project start and due dates for context

### 3. Real-time Task Statistics
- **Total Tasks**: Count of all tasks assigned to the team member
- **Status Breakdown**: Tasks categorized by status (completed, in progress, not started)
- **Overdue Tracking**: Automatic detection of overdue tasks based on due dates
- **Active Task Count**: Real-time count of current active tasks

### 4. Enhanced Workload Calculations
- **Current Tasks**: Updated count based on active tasks (not started + in progress)
- **Hours Allocated**: Sum of estimated hours for all active tasks
- **Utilization Percentage**: Calculated based on total allocated hours vs. capacity

### 5. Data Consistency
- **ObjectId Conversion**: All MongoDB ObjectIds converted to strings for JSON compatibility
- **Dual ID Fields**: Both `_id` and `id` fields provided for frontend compatibility
- **Proper Sorting**: Tasks sorted by due date, team members by creation date

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
# Get team members with task details for an organization
result = list_team_members("507f1f77bcf86cd799439013")

if result["status"] == "success":
    team_members = result["data"]["team_members"]
    
    for member in team_members:
        print(f"Member: {member['name']}")
        print(f"Active Tasks: {member['workload']['currentTasks']}")
        
        # Access task details
        tasks = member["tasks"]["assigned_tasks"]
        for task in tasks:
            project_name = task["project"]["name"] if task["project"] else "No Project"
            print(f"  - {task['name']} [{task['status']}] in {project_name}")
```

### Analyzing Team Workload
```python
result = list_team_members(organization_id)
team_members = result["data"]["team_members"]

# Calculate team statistics
total_active_tasks = sum(
    member["workload"]["currentTasks"] 
    for member in team_members
)

overloaded_members = [
    member for member in team_members 
    if member["workload"]["utilizationPercentage"] > 80
]

print(f"Total active tasks across team: {total_active_tasks}")
print(f"Overloaded members: {len(overloaded_members)}")
```

### Project Assignment Analysis
```python
result = list_team_members(organization_id)
team_members = result["data"]["team_members"]

# Group tasks by project
project_assignments = {}
for member in team_members:
    for task in member["tasks"]["assigned_tasks"]:
        if task["project"]:
            project_name = task["project"]["name"]
            if project_name not in project_assignments:
                project_assignments[project_name] = []
            project_assignments[project_name].append({
                "member": member["name"],
                "task": task["name"],
                "status": task["status"]
            })

# Display project assignments
for project, assignments in project_assignments.items():
    print(f"Project: {project}")
    for assignment in assignments:
        print(f"  {assignment['member']}: {assignment['task']} [{assignment['status']}]")
```
